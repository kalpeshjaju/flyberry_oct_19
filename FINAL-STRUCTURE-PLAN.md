## QUESTIONS FOR KALPESH

1. **Does this structure make sense?**
   - Identity → Current State → Evolution → Market Data → Verification → Execution

2. **For Hero Product Stories**, do you have:
   - Origin stories (where products come from)?
   - Craftsmanship details (how they're made)?
   - Quality credentials (certifications, partnerships)?
   - Emotional narratives (why they matter)?

3. **For Brand Persona**, should Flyberry be:
   - Sophisticated educator (teaches about gourmet quality)?
   - Trusted curator (selects best from around world)?
   - Luxury specialist (serves Fortune 500 + affluent)?
   - All of the above?

4. **Priority**: Should I start with:
   - **Option A**: Create brand identity docs first (story, persona, product stories)?
   - **Option B**: Organize existing docs first, then add identity?
   - **Option C**: Create everything in parallel?

**STATUS**: ⏳ AWAITING STRUCTURE APPROVAL

**READY TO**: Begin brand identity creation once approved
