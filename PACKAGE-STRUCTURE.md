## NEXT STEPS

1. **Get approval** on this structure from Kalpesh
2. **Create missing Foundation docs** (8 documents)
3. **Create Execution docs** (2 documents)
4. **Create master guide** (00-START-HERE.md)
5. **Copy existing docs** to correct folders
6. **Verify completeness** (all 20 docs present)

---

## TIMELINE ESTIMATE

- **Foundation docs creation**: 2-3 hours (research + consolidation)
- **Execution docs creation**: 30-60 min (checklists + templates)
- **Master guide creation**: 30 min (navigation + summaries)
- **File organization**: 10 min (copying + verification)

**Total**: ~4 hours to complete package

---

**Status**: ⏳ AWAITING APPROVAL

**Question for Kalpesh**:
1. Does this structure make sense? (Foundation → Strategy → QA → Execution)
2. Should I create the 10 missing Foundation docs? (requires info about Flyberry's current state)
3. Any documents missing from this list?
