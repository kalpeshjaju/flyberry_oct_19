### **Step 3: Agency Presentations** (Week 5)

**Format**: 1 hour per agency

**Agenda**:
- 0-5 min: Welcome, introductions
- 5-25 min: Agency presents their proposal
- 25-45 min: Q&A, discussion
- 45-55 min: Deep-dive on 1-2 concepts they'd explore
- 55-60 min: Next steps, timeline

**Questions to Ask**:

**Process Questions**:
1. Walk us through your typical brand identity process
2. How many concept rounds are included in your quote?
3. What's your revision policy? (how many rounds included?)
4. Who exactly would work on this project? (meet the team)
5. What happens if we're not happy with initial concepts?

**Portfolio Questions**:
6. Tell us about [specific project from their portfolio]
7. What was the biggest challenge in that project?
8. How did you balance client input with design expertise?
9. Show us a before/after transformation you're proud of

**Flyberry-Specific Questions**:
10. After reading our brief, what's the biggest design challenge?
11. How would you approach the Fortune 500 integration visually?
12. What's your initial instinct on color direction?
13. If you had to describe our new brand in 3 words, what would they be?
14. What would you want to keep from our current identity?

**Red Flags** (concerns):
- Dismissive of your input ("just trust us")
- Unrealistic timeline (too fast = rushed, too slow = inefficient)
- Vague about process ("we'll figure it out")
- No questions for you (not curious)
- Only talks aesthetics, not strategy

**Green Flags** (good signs):
- Asks lots of questions about your business
- Challenges your brief (respectfully) with better ideas
- Shows deep understanding of your market
- Excited about the project
- Clear, transparent process

---

### **Step 4: Final Selection** (Week 5, End)

**Decision Matrix**:

Create a 2x2 matrix:

```
HIGH FIT, HIGH BUDGET → Premium choice (stretch budget?)
HIGH FIT, LOW BUDGET  → Best value (likely winner)

LOW FIT, HIGH BUDGET  → Pass (not worth it)
LOW FIT, LOW BUDGET   → Pass (cheap but wrong)
```

**Final Considerations**:

**Beyond the Scorecard**:
- [ ] Do you trust them with your brand?
- [ ] Did they "get it" immediately or need lots of explanation?
- [ ] Can you see yourself working with them for 12 weeks?
- [ ] Do they have bandwidth to start when you need?
- [ ] Do they have relevant expertise (food/premium/packaging)?

**Gut Check**:
- [ ] Excited about working with them?
- [ ] Confident they'll deliver?
- [ ] Comfortable with their process?

**Practical**:
- [ ] Budget fits (no surprises)?
- [ ] Timeline works?
- [ ] Contract terms acceptable?

**The Decision**: Agency _______________ selected because:
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

---

- [ ] Budget approved (no surprises later)

### **3. Agency Partnership**
- [ ] Right agency selected (expertise + culture fit)

- [ ] Timeline is achievable (not rushed)
- [ ] Budget is adequate (not cutting corners)
- [ ] You're prepared to invest time (reviews, feedback, decisions)

---

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### **Pitfall 1: "We'll figure it out as we go"**
**Problem**: No clear direction = agency guesses = you hate everything = redos = delays

**Solution**: Do Week 1-3 work BEFORE engaging agency

---

### **Pitfall 2: "Design by committee"**
**Problem**: 5 people with opinions = 5 different directions = paralysis

**Solution**: 1 decision maker (founder), 1-2 advisors (max), clear hierarchy

---

### **Pitfall 3: "Make it look premium but cheaper"**
**Problem**: Premium design requires premium investment (good designers cost money)

**Solution**: Budget realistically. If ₹7.5-11.5L seems high, remember: this is a ₹35 Cr company aiming for ₹100 Cr

---

### **Pitfall 4: "Just copy [competitor brand]"**
**Problem**: Copying = no differentiation = why would customers choose you?

**Solution**: Learn from (inspiration), don't copy (imitation)

---

### **Pitfall 5: "We need it in 4 weeks"**
**Problem**: Great design takes time. Rushed = mediocre results

**Solution**: 8-12 weeks minimum for quality work (logo + packaging + guidelines)

---

### **Pitfall 6: "Unlimited revisions included"**
**Problem**: You'll revise forever, never commit, project never ends

**Solution**: 2-3 revision rounds per phase. After that, additional rounds are paid. Forces decisiveness.

---

### **Pitfall 7: "Agency knows best, don't question them"**
**Problem**: You abdicate responsibility. If results are wrong, you suffer (not them)

**Solution**: Collaborative partnership. Agency brings design expertise, you bring business/market expertise. Both essential.

---

## WEEK 0: BEFORE YOU START (PRE-WORK)

Before Week 1, do these 3 things:

### **1. Secure Internal Approval** (1 day)

**Get approval for**:
- [ ] Budget: ₹7.5-11.5 Lakhs (brand assets)
- [ ] Timeline: 12-16 weeks (design + production)
- [ ] Founder time: 50-80 hours over 6 weeks (prep + reviews)
- [ ] Team time: 20-30 hours (input + implementation)

**Without these approvals, don't start. You'll waste time.**

---

### **2. Assemble Your Core Team** (1 day)

Who needs to be involved?

- [ ] **Founder** (final decisions)
- [ ] **Marketing Lead** (day-to-day brand custodian)
- [ ] **Operations** (packaging constraints, supplier liaison)
- [ ] **Finance** (budget tracking, vendor payments)
- [ ] **Design Advisor** (optional - someone with design sense)

**Have a kickoff meeting**: "We're doing a brand identity evolution. Here's the plan. Here's your role."

---

### **3. Block Time in Calendar** (30 min)

**Block these sessions NOW**:

**Week 1**:
- [ ] Day 1-2: Founder Decision Session (4 hours)
- [ ] Day 3: Operations Team Input (1 hour)
- [ ] Day 4: Sales Team Input (1 hour)
- [ ] Day 5: Internal All-Hands (1 hour)

- [ ] Day 17-18: Support Materials (4 hours)
- [ ] Day 19-20: Presentation Prep (3 hours)
- [ ] Day 21: Final Review (2 hours)

**Week 4-5**:
- [ ] Agency presentations (4-5 hours)

**Total**: ~50 hours over 5 weeks = 2 hours/day

**Put it in calendar NOW. Non-negotiable time.**

---

## FINAL CHECKLIST: ARE YOU READY?

Before starting Week 1, confirm:

- [ ] I have read all 51 documents in the brand package
- [ ] I understand our current state (FY25: ₹35 Cr, challenges, opportunities)

- [ ] I have blocked time in my calendar (50 hours over 5 weeks)
- [ ] I am ready to make decisions (not delegate everything to agency)
- [ ] I am committed to the process (will not rush or shortcut)

**If all boxes checked → START WEEK 1**

**If any box unchecked → Address that first**

---

## NEED HELP?

If you get stuck at any point:

**Week 2 Struggles** (creative direction):
- Look at 10 premium brands you admire

**Week 3 Struggles** (writing the brief):
- Use the templates in this document (copy-paste structure)
- Fill in your specific details from brand package
- Get someone to proofread (grammar, clarity)

**Week 4-5 Struggles** (selecting agency):
- Trust the scorecard (data over gut)
