## BENEFITS OF THIS INTEGRATION

### **Before (Phase 0 Standalone):**
‚ùå Had to complete "Phase 0" before knowing the brand
‚ùå Phase 0 came before Act 1 (WHO WE ARE)
‚ùå Confusing sequence: build foundation before knowing what you're building on

### **After (Integrated):**
‚úÖ Proper sequence: Know brand (Act 1) ‚Üí Discover insights (Act 3) ‚Üí Build strategy (Act 4)
‚úÖ Brand foundation elements integrated where they logically belong
‚úÖ No standalone prerequisites - natural flow from knowledge to strategy to execution
