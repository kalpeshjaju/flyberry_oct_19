## Doc 43: Risk Mitigation Plan - What Could Go Wrong & How We Respond

**Purpose**: Identify critical risks to repositioning and prepare mitigation strategies
**Last Updated**: October 12, 2025

---

## WHY RISK PLANNING MATTERS

**Reality**: Every repositioning faces risks. The question isn't IF something will go wrong, but WHEN and HOW we respond.

**This Document:**
- Identifies 5 critical risks (probability + impact)
- Provides warning signs to watch for
- Outlines mitigation strategies (before/during/after)
- Prepares contingency plans if mitigation fails

**Goal**: No surprises. We're prepared for what could go wrong.

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

**Probability Scale**: 1-10 (1 = unlikely, 10 = certain)
**Impact Scale**: 1-10 (1 = minor, 10 = catastrophic)
**Risk Score**: Probability × Impact

**Priority Levels:**
- **CRITICAL** (Score 60+): Top priority, demands immediate mitigation
- **HIGH** (Score 40-59): Important, needs robust planning
- **MEDIUM** (Score 20-39): Monitor closely, have plan ready

---

## THE 5 CRITICAL RISKS

---

## RISK #1: CUSTOMER CONFUSION

### **Risk Score: 56 (HIGH)**
- **Probability**: 7/10
- **Impact**: 8/10

---

### **RISK DESCRIPTION:**

Existing customers don't understand the repositioning and become confused or concerned:

---

### **WARNING SIGNS:**

---

### **MITIGATION STRATEGIES:**

   - "What's changing?"
   - "Is quality different?"
   - "Why new packaging?"
   - "Why repositioning?"

   - Build social proof

---

### **CONTINGENCY PLAN:**

**If confusion is >30% of feedback:**
1. ⏸️ **Pause full rollout** (don't add more channels yet)
2. 🔍 **Deep-dive analysis** (what's confusing? which messages?)
3. ✏️ **Refine messaging** (simplify, clarify, reassure)
4. 📢 **Add more transition communication**:
   - Founder video explaining changes
   - More detailed FAQ
   - 1-on-1 outreach to concerned customers
5. 🔄 **Gradual relaunch** (test messaging before full rollout)

---

## RISK #2: PRICE REJECTION

### **Risk Score: 54 (HIGH)**
- **Probability**: 6/10
- **Impact**: 9/10

---

### **RISK DESCRIPTION:**

Customers reject the new premium pricing and consider Flyberry too expensive:
- "₹599 for dates? I used to get them for ₹399. Too expensive."
- "I'll just buy from Happilo instead."
- Cart abandonment at checkout due to price shock

---

### **WARNING SIGNS:**

- ✋ Sales drop >20% immediately after price increase
- ✋ Cart abandonment rate spikes (>70%)
- ✋ Price-related complaints increase
- ✋ Comments: "Too expensive", "Overpriced"
- ✋ Customers switching to competitors
- ✋ Trial sizes selling, but premium sizes not moving

---

### **MITIGATION STRATEGIES:**

### **BEFORE Launch:**
✅ **Gradual price increases** (not overnight jump)
   - Phase 1: +10% (₹399 → ₹439)
   - Phase 2: +15% more (₹439 → ₹505)
   - Phase 3: Final positioning (₹505 → ₹599)
   - Spread over 6 months

✅ **Premium tier introduction**
   - Keep some mid-priced options (₹299-399)
   - Introduce ultra-premium (₹599-999)
   - Choice reduces rejection

✅ **Value communication**
   - "Fortune 500 quality now accessible"
   - "₹599 vs Bateel ₹2,500 for same dates"

✅ **Trial sizes maintained**
   - ₹199 entry point remains
   - Gateway to premium purchases

---

### **DURING Launch:**
✅ **Justification messaging EVERYWHERE**
   - Packaging: "Cold-chain protected. Fortune 500 quality."
   - Website: "Why ₹599? Medina sourcing, cold chain, Fortune 500 standards"
   - In-store: Staff explain value

✅ **Compare to alternatives**
   - "Bateel charges ₹2,500. Same Ajwa dates, ₹599."
   - "Imports are ₹2,000+. We source direct."

✅ **Bundle offers** (value, not discount)
   - "3 packs for ₹1,699" (saves ₹100, but not "discount")
   - "Gourmet Selection: 5 products ₹2,499" (value bundle)

✅ **Sampling program**
   - Let customers taste before buying premium
   - Quality justifies price

---

### **AFTER Launch:**
✅ **Monitor price elasticity**
   - Sales impact per ₹50 increase
   - Which products are price-sensitive?
   - Which justify premium easily?

✅ **A/B test pricing** (carefully)
   - Different price points
   - Measure conversion
   - Find optimal balance

✅ **Value perception survey**
   - Do customers feel it's worth it?
   - What would improve perceived value?

---

### **CONTINGENCY PLAN:**

**If sales drop >20% and don't recover in 8 weeks:**
1. ⏸️ **Pause further price increases**
2. 🔄 **Reintroduce mid-priced line**:
   - "Flyberry Select" (₹299-449 range)
   - Keep accessible options
3. 🌟 **Ultra-premium as "Flyberry Reserve"**:
   - ₹599-999 range
   - Clearly differentiated
4. 🎯 **Dual pricing strategy**:
   - Select: Accessible premium
   - Reserve: Ultra-luxury
   - Both under Flyberry brand

**Note**: Only if absolutely necessary. Goal is to hold premium positioning.

---

## RISK #3: COMPETITOR RESPONSE

### **Risk Score**: **48 (HIGH)**
- **Probability**: 8/10
- **Impact**: 6/10

---

### **RISK DESCRIPTION:**

Happilo, Farmley, or new entrants respond aggressively:
- Copy Fortune 500 positioning: "We're trusted by companies too!"
- Attack pricing: "Flyberry is overpriced. Same quality, half the price."
- Launch competing products with similar claims

---

### **WARNING SIGNS:**

- ✋ Competitor ads directly targeting Flyberry
- ✋ Competitors start Fortune 500 name-dropping (even if false)
- ✋ Price wars begin (competitors undercut by 30-40%)
- ✋ Customers saying: "But Happilo says they have Fortune 500 clients too..."
- ✋ Market confusion about who's really Fortune 500-trusted

---

### **MITIGATION STRATEGIES:**

### **BEFORE Launch:**
✅ **Build defensible moat**
   - Fortune 500 clients are REAL and provable
   - Can't be easily replicated (10+ years relationships)

✅ **Legal protection** (if possible)
   - Trademark "Trusted by 50+ Fortune 500 Companies"?
   - Consult IP lawyer

✅ **Get client testimonials ON RECORD**
   - Legal permission to mention clients
   - Written testimonials
   - Can showcase logos? (Even generic: "Leading tech companies", "Global banks")

✅ **Build proof**
   - Case studies (with permission)
   - Photos of corporate hampers
   - Client renewal records (10+ years)

---

### **DURING Launch:**
✅ **Monitor competitor moves weekly**
   - Competitive scanning
   - Track their messaging
   - Prepared to respond

✅ **Prepared response**:
   - "We have 50+ Fortune 500 clients for 10+ years. We're not claiming it. We're proving it."
   - "Call [Company]. Ask who they use for corporate gifting."

✅ **Transparency wins**
   - If competitors fake claims: Call them out (diplomatically)
   - "We can prove it. Can they?"

✅ **Differentiate beyond Fortune 500**
   - Also: 7 countries sourcing
   - Also: Industry-first cold chain
   - Also: Complete 9-category portfolio
   - Fortune 500 is one of 5 pillars, not only asset

---

### **AFTER Launch:**
✅ **Build additional differentiation**
   - Product innovation (stay ahead)
   - Service excellence
   - Technology (QR codes, traceability)
   - Customer experience

✅ **Make Fortune 500 one of many strengths**
   - Not solely reliant on one differentiator
   - Multi-dimensional positioning

---

### **CONTINGENCY PLAN:**

**If competitors successfully copy-cat:**
1. 🎯 **Double down on other pillars**:
   - Shift emphasis: Fortune 500 → 7 countries + Cold chain
   - "We don't just claim quality. We cold-chain protect it."
2. 🚀 **Out-innovate**:
   - Launch Reserve Collection
   - Launch new tech (app, traceability)
   - Stay 2 steps ahead
3. 📢 **Transparency campaign**:
   - "Here are our 50+ clients. Can competitors show theirs?"
   - Build trust through proof, not claims

**Remember**: We have 10+ years of real relationships. That's impossible to fake or replicate quickly.

---

### **Risk Score: 50 (HIGH)**
