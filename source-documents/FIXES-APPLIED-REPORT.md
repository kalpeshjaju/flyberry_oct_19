## ISSUES IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED

### üö® ISSUE #1: Category Count Inconsistency ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Documents contradicted each other
- 16 documents said "8 categories"
- 4 documents said "9 categories"
- Doc 38 said BOTH

**Root Cause**: Phase 0 integration introduced "9 categories" without updating old documents

**Ground Truth Established**: **8 categories** (per Doc 20 - Master Strategy)

**8 Categories Are**:
1. Dates
2. Exotic Nuts
3. Vacuum-Fried Chips
4. Seeds
5. Berries
6. Dried Fruits
7. Date Innovations
8. Date-Based Products

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated ALL 4 documents that said "9 categories" to "8 categories"

**Result**: ‚úÖ **100% consistency - ALL documents now say "8 categories"**

**Problem**: Documents contradicted each other
- 8 documents said "42+ products"
- 6 documents said "55+ SKUs (37 unique products)"
- Doc 38 and Doc 14 said BOTH

**Root Cause**: Phase 0 integration introduced "55+ SKUs" without updating old documents

**Ground Truth Established**: **44 unique products** (per Doc 38 verification table)

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed all "55+ SKUs (37 unique products)" to "44 unique products"
