# PHASE 0 INTEGRATION MAP
## How Phase 0 Content Was Distributed Into Package Structure

**Date**: October 12, 2025
**Purpose**: Track where all Phase 0 content was integrated to maintain data accuracy

---

## INTEGRATION STRATEGY

**Original**: Phase 0 was standalone document (1,738 lines, 11 gaps addressed)

**New Approach**: Content distributed into proper sequential flow:
1. **Act 1 (WHO WE ARE) comes FIRST** - Know the brand
2. **Act 3 & 4 get Phase 0 strategic content** - Build on brand knowledge
3. **Act 6 gets execution content** - GTM & Risk

## CORRECT READING ORDER

**BEFORE** (Incorrect):
```
Phase 0 → Act 1 → Acts 2-6
(Trying to build brand foundation before knowing the brand)
```

**AFTER** (Correct):
```
Act 1 (WHO WE ARE - Know the brand)
   ↓
Act 2 (WHERE WE ARE TODAY - Current state)
   ↓
Act 3 (WHAT WE DISCOVERED - Enhanced with JTBD, pain points)
   ↓
Act 4 (WHERE WE SHOULD GO - Enhanced with narrative, positioning, messaging, tone)
   ↓
Act 5 (IS THIS READY - Enhanced with constraints)
   ↓
Act 6 (HOW WE EXECUTE - Enhanced with GTM, risks)
```
