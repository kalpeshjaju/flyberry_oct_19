## READING PATHS

### **Path 1: Executive (90 min)**
Read only these for high-level understanding:
- 01 (Origin), 03 (Hero Products), 05 (Fortune 500)
- 12 (Challenges), 17 (Opportunities)
- 19 (Vision), 20 (Strategy), 25 (Goal)
- 26 (Audit), 29 (Execution Overview), 40 (Investment)

### **Path 2: Marketing Team (3 hours)**
Deep-dive on brand identity and customer:
- **Act 1: ALL 7 docs** (who we are - MUST internalize)
- **Act 3: ALL 5 docs** (what customers say)
- **Act 4: Docs 22-24** (messaging, persona, differentiation)
- **Act 6: Docs 31-35** (brand assets, content, training)

### **Path 3: Complete (7.5 hours)**
Read every document in order for full understanding.

---

## KEY PRINCIPLE: CONTINUITY

**Every document must:**
1. ✅ **Start** with a clear connection to the previous document
2. ✅ **End** with a clear transition to the next document
3. ✅ **Stand alone** if someone reads it independently
4. ✅ **Build** on information from earlier documents
5. ✅ **Prepare** the reader for what's coming next

**Example of perfect continuity:**

```
Doc 05 ending:
"This Fortune 500 trust reflects who we are as a brand.
But what IS our brand personality? → (Doc 06)"

Doc 06 starting:
"If Flyberry was a person, who would we be?"
[Content about brand persona]

Doc 06 ending:
"This personality shapes our promise to customers.
What exactly do we guarantee? → (Doc 07)"

Doc 07 starting:
"Our brand promise is simple but uncompromising..."
```

---

## NEXT STEPS

**1. Structure Approval** (5 min)
Does this narrative flow make sense?

**2. Information Gathering** (30 min)
For Act 1 (WHO WE ARE), I need:
- Flyberry origin story (founding year, founder vision, why started)
- Product origin stories (where each hero product comes from)
- Fortune 500 clients (any specific names? or keep anonymous?)
- Brand personality (sophisticated? friendly? aspirational?)

**3. Content Creation** (4-6 hours)
Create all 50 documents with perfect continuity

**4. Review & Refinement** (1-2 hours)
Ensure every transition is smooth

---

**STATUS**: ⏳ AWAITING APPROVAL

**Question**: Does this sequential structure with continuity work for you?
