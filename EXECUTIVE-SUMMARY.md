## ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS FIXING (All Minor, 1-2 Hours)

### Issue 1: Internal Content Leaked to External Package

**Found**: Act 5 audit document (`docs/act-5-validation.html`)
```
Line 103: "Auditor: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)" ❌
Line 105: "before ₹75L investment" ❌
Lines 500+: Internal quality scores (9.5/10, 10/10) ❌
Lines 514, 719: "Josh Lowman framework" ❌
```

**Fix**: Move entire file to `/docs/internal/` folder (hide from client)
**Time**: 5 minutes
**Impact**: HIGH - Must fix before external sharing

---

### Issue 2: Homepage Shows Budget Figures

**Found**: Both index files show investment amounts
```
Line 443-445: "Investment: ₹82.5-86.5L" + "Total budget" ❌
Line 654: "~12x ROI on ₹82.5L investment" ❌
```

**Fix**: Remove budget figures, keep only qualitative descriptions
**Time**: 30 minutes
**Impact**: HIGH - May scare client before plan is aligned

---

### Issue 3: Fortune 500 Over-Repetition (Your Concern Validated)

**Found**: 180+ mentions across package
- Act 2: 45 mentions ⚠️ (excessive)
- Act 4: 65 mentions ⚠️ (over-emphasis)

**Current Storytelling Ratio**:
```
Fortune 500: 60% ❌
Product/innovation: 20%
Values/user stories: 10%
Other: 10%
```

**Recommended Ratio**:
```
Innovation/taste: 40% (lead with "Reimagining Food")
Product transformation: 25% (okra→chips, dates→syrups)
Fortune 500: 20% (supporting trust signal)
Values/user stories: 15% (human connection)
```

**Fix**: Rebalance Act 4 storytelling, add innovation/user stories
**Time**: 4-6 hours
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Improves narrative balance

---

### Issue 4: Act 2 Corporate Gifting Too Confident (Your Concern Valid)

**Found**: B2B → Consumer transfer stated as fact, not hypothesis

**Current Language**:
```
"Fortune 500 validation will transfer to consumer trust" ❌
"₹50 Crores in hidden brand equity" ❌ (assumes causality)
"Path to ₹100 Cr revenue" ❌ (guaranteed outcome tone)
```

**Your Concern** (from input):
> "Corporate gifting is a great angle - how much of this will impact consumer trust, we need to experiment and check."

**Our Recommendation** (aligned with your view):
```
"Fortune 500 validation suggests premium potential—needs consumer validation" ✅

"Corporate credibility hypothesis: Can B2B trust influence consumer choice?
We'll test this approach with clear success metrics and decision gates." ✅

"Target: ₹100 Cr revenue IF repositioning validates consumer resonance" ✅
```

**Fix**: Add experiment-first language, test-and-validate approach
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Impact**: HIGH - Shows honest, strategic thinking
